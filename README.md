# SociaNetwork App
An application for being connected with those you always loved.
<br>

## 1. Technologies
This is a project to learn how to work with:
* React, 
* Redux, 
* NodeJs,
* Mongo and 
* Mongoose. 

Please feel free to explore my code. I welcome any suggestion or comment to improve it.
<br>

## 2. Installation

This is one of the two parts of the application, be sure you have cloned both (back and front) or it won't run succesfully.

First of all, open a terminal and clone the repository in the desired directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Adrian-M-A/SocialNetworkBack

```
Second, enter in the back folder, open a terminal, install all the dependencies and run the backend:
```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
<br>

## 3. Management

For having a better experience we recommend to install and run the frontend. Please check that folder and follow the instructions.

If you prefer to only explore the backend's possibilities go to the routes folder to see all the available possibilities that this app offers.
